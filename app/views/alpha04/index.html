				<p>You can apply for Hardship Payments if your benefit has been stopped (you've been 'sanctioned') and you can't afford your basic living costs.</p>

				<h2 class="heading-medium">Who can apply</h2>
				<p>You can apply if you've been sanctioned while on:</p>
				<ul class="list-bullet">
					<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance">Jobseeker's Allowance</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance">Employment Support Allowance</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/overview">Universal Credit</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>To get Hardship Payment you must:</p>
				<ul class="list-bullet">
					<li>be 16 or over</li>
					<li>be unable to pay for your basic needs (this means things like food, rent or clothing) or those of a young person you're responsible for - this includes if you're pregnant</li>
					<li>be unable to get money from elsewhere, eg from you family, work or by claiming other benefits you're eligible for</li>
					<li>stick to the terms and conditions of the benefit that's been stopped, eg you must continue to look for work if on Jobseeker's Allowance</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="heading-medium">What you'll get</h2>
				<p>You can get between 60% and 80% of the amount of benefit you were getting before you were sanctioned. The exact amount is based on your circumstances.</p>
				<p>You usually don't have to pay the money back unless you're on Universal Credit.</p>
				<p>If you're on Universal Credit you'll usually pay the money back in small amounts each month once you're being paid your full benefit again.</p>

				<h2 class="heading-medium">How to apply</h2>
				<p>Call Jobcentre Plus if you usually get Jobseeker's Allowance or Employment Support Allowance.</p>

				<h2 class="heading-medium">What happens next</h3>
				<p>You'll usually have to go to a face-to-face meeting at a Jobcentre within a day of applying. At the meeting you must prove you can't afford basic living costs, eg by showing household bills and bank statements.</p>
